## Hello!
Thanks for visiting my profile.

I love making and learning programming languages. I also love learning math and computer science - especially cryptography.

I also really like progrmaming in Rust for some reason!

I'm currently working on my book/journey description "Learning Cryptography: One Byte at a Time" and just trying to learn anything new!
